# Simple-Momentum-Strategy

### Introduction

In this project, I learnt to implement a simple trading strategy on my own, and tested to see if it has the potential to be profitable. I specified a universe of stocks and time range. I generated a trading signal based on a momentum indicator. I then computed the signal for the time range and applied it to the dataset to produce projected returns. Finally, I performed a statistical test on the mean of the returns to conclude if there is alpha in the signal. For the dataset, I used end of the day data from Quotemedia.
